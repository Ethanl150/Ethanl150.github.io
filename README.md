In this repository I created a working application from scratch for my portfolio. This website has three pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. I used Bootstrap as well as custom CSS to style the site. All three pages are made up of three main sections: Navigation, Main, and Footer. The pages are static, and the contact form is not functional. One of the main goals of this application was to make sure that all of the content of the pages, including background images, are responsive to the screen size of the end user's device. I accomplished this using Bootstrap's "rows" and "columns", as well as media queries.
